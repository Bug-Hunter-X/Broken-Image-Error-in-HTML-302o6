This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to broken images. The `bug.html` file contains an image tag that references a non-existent image source.  The error is subtle because it doesn't produce a syntax error; however, it manifests as a broken image in the browser. The solution file `solution.html` shows how to handle missing images gracefully by using a placeholder image or alternative text.
